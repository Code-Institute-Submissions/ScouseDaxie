# Scouse Daxie - README

A social space targeting Dachshund owners in Liverpool. The site aims to provide community through existing social media and free organsied social events. The site offers advice and tips on dog friendly bars, pubs, restaurants and other venues/establishments along with training tips and 3rd party training in the area.

The site could eventually generate revenue through attracting local businesses and suppliers to advertise or promote their relevant offerings. One future option is to create an online store platform selling relevant products either directly or in acting as an intermediary.

Whist the site currently heavily relies upon existing social media platforms for inter-user interaction, user to business interaction and events sign-up and bookings the intention is to build thie functionality locally into the site with time. 

The site can expand to include additional content for other dog breeds in the geographic area and also expand to other locations in the future. By narrowing the target audience initially it allows bespoke, attractive content and a managable scope. Choosing a popular breed increases the interest in the content and initial user pick-up.
